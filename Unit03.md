title: "BIO402: Pathobiology"
course_description: "A detailed study of the subject of human disease, placing special emphasis on the cause of disease at the tissue level. Focuses on what happens at the molecular and cellular level during inflammation and the immune response, infectious disease, and diseases of the immune system and body systems."

**Unit 3: Losing the Battle—Infectious Disease, Cell Injury and Death,
and Neoplasia** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, you will learn what happens when the immune system is
challenged.  We will discuss infectious diseases and examine cell injury
and death. Infectious disease can be caused by numerous different
microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and even
parasitic worms, among other agents.  They are typically spread from
direct contact via person to person or may be carried through insect
vectors such as mosquitoes or ticks or even in food or the environment. 
To learn more about specific organisms, you may want to take [BIO307:
Microbiology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio307/).*  
  
 *We will also look at what happens when cells die, both normally and
abnormally.  These death processes are referred to as programmed cell
death or apoptosis or death as a result of injury or disease, known as
necrosis.  Finally, we will see what happens when cells no longer heed
their growth checkpoints and grow uncontrollably.  You likely know of
this as cancer.  *

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.1: 3 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 3.3: 3 hours

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Define the term infectious disease, giving examples of causative
    agents and resulting disease states
-   Differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.
-   Describe how normal cells become immortalized to become cancer
    cells.
