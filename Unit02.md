**Unit 2: The Inflammatory Reaction and the Immune Response** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to the ways in which the body protects
itself from microorganisms and other causes of disease (including its
own cells!).  We will start with the body’s first line of defense, which
includes the skin, mucous membranes, and the body’s own antimicrobial
secretions.  Next, you will see what happens when this barrier is
penetrated.  Finally, you will see how the body prepares itself for
future attacks. *  
 *             
 Note that the immune system is comprised of two divisions: the innate
or non-specific division and the adaptive or specific division.  The
innate division is further broken down into the cell mediated and
humoral divisions.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.3: 3 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Describe the role of inflammation and the inflammatory response.
-   Identify the major factors involved in the innate (non-specific)
    immune response.
-   Compare and contrast the cells involved in the innate and adaptive
    (specific) immune response.

     Instructions:  Watch this short video (4:06 minutes) about the
    inflammatory response.  Notice how the body responds in a
    non-discriminatory manner with this type of response.

     Instructions:  View this video (16:20 minutes), which introduces
    the first and second lines of defense and then discusses
    phagocytosis.  The term phagocytosis means refers to the process by
    which phagocytic cells engulf microorganisms, dead cells, and other
    debris.

    Microbiology and Immunology On-line: Dr. Gene Mayer’s *Immunology*,
    “Innate (Non-Specific) Immunity” (HTML)  
        
     Instructions:  Read the following five sections: “Overview of the
    Immune System,” “Innate (Non-Specific) Immunity,” “Phagocytosis and
    Intracellular Killing,” “Nitric Oxide-Dependent Killing,” and
    “Non-Specific Killer Cells.”  These readings will help you
    understand how the body prevents microorganisms from penetrating
    into its interior and the non-specific mechanisms that respond when
    such an invasion takes place.

     Instructions:  This website is provided by the American Museum of
    Natural History.  As you have already learned, there are a number of
    mechanisms in place that prevent microorganisms from penetrating the
    body’s exterior and causing infection and disease.  For this
    exercise, play the game “Infection.”  Although this is a simple
    game, it provides a very realistic view of the complexity of the
    body’s own defenses.
