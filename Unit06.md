**Unit 6: Postmortem** <span id="6"></span> 
*Until now, we have discussed what is considered “normal pathology” and
examined the impact that disease has on the pathophysiology of an
organism.  In this unit, we will see what happens postmortem (with
death) and how the information obtained can be used to confirm a
suspected diagnosis or to determine the cause of death.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 5.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 2 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 3.25 hours

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Identify major changes that occur to a body postmortem.
-   Compare and contrast the usefulness of medical and criminal
    autopsies.

    poisoning case.  This autopsy video shows you that what appears to
    be true and what is actually true can be two very different things. 
    Other videos are available on this site, including an autopsy of a
    plague case.  While you are not required to watch these, you might
    find them interesting.

     Instructions:  This short video argues that confirming the presence
    of amyloid plaques in the brain is the only definitive means of
    diagnosing Alzheimer’s Disease.  These plaques can only be detected
    on an autopsy.
