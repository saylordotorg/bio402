The purpose of this course is to explore the subject of human disease,
placing special emphasis on the cause of disease at the tissue level. 
We will pay close attention to the underlying mechanisms that initiate
and perpetuate the disease state.  Much can be learned about the causes
of disease at the molecular and cellular level; we will accordingly
spend quite a bit of time examining molecules, cells, and tissues and
determining how the disruption of their normal functioning by various
known and unknown causes can lead to disease. We will begin this course
with a basic review of molecules, cells, and tissues in the human body. 
We will then discuss the body’s first line of defense, the inflammatory
reaction, and the immune system. Finally, we will survey the body’s
organ systems.  We will approach each of the systems by examining the
ways in which a prototype disease impacts its functioning.  (These
“prototypes” will be diseases that impact a large number of patients
around the world.)  We will conclude by discussing what can be learned
about a disease and the cause of death using an autopsy examination.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to  
  

-   Explain how atoms combine to form larger molecules such as proteins
    and carbohydrates.
-   Compare and contrast inflammation, the innate (non-specific) immune
    response, and the adaptive immune response.
-   Define the term infectious disease, giving examples of causative
    agents and resulting disease states.
-   Differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis.
-   Describe how normal cells become immortalized to become cancer
    cells.
-   Compare and contrast diseases involving an overactive and
    underactive immune system, including SCID, HIV, allergies, and
    asthma as examples.
-   Explain how an autoimmune response leads to diseases such as Type 1
    diabetes mellitus and lupus (SLE).
-   Explain how genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, are passed
    from parents to offspring and the changes that occur to the cells
    involved.
-   Describe how changes in the skeletal system and skeletal muscle
    anatomy and physiology lead to the development of diseases such as
    osteoporosis and muscular dystrophy.
-   Identify the changes that occur in the circulatory system with
    atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.
-   Outline the major changes that occur  in renal diseases such as
    glomerulonephritis.
-   Diagram the levels of damage seen with first-, second-, and
    third-degree burns.
-   Write a list of cellular and tissue changes seen with various
    diseases, including cirrhosis of the liver, thyroid disorders like
    hypothyroidism, nervous system diseases like Alzheimer’s, and in
    sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis.
-   Identify major changes that occur to a body postmortem and how the
    autopsy is used to recognize normal and abnormal changes.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:  
  
 √    Have access to a computer.  
  
 √    Have continuous broadband Internet access.  
  
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,

√    Have completed [BIO101: Introduction to Molecular and Cellular

### Course Information

**Welcome to BIO402!  **Below, please find some general information on
the course and its requirements.

**Course Designer**:  Amy L. Thompson, PhD, MLS(ASCP)

**Primary Resources**:  This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials.   However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:

-   Andrew Rader’s “[Chem4Kids](http://www.chem4kids.com/)!”
-   University of South Carolina School of Medicine’s Microbiology and
    Immunology On-line: Dr. Gene Mayer’s
    [“Immunology”](http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/bowers/immune%20cells.htm)
-   BioEd’s Online Presentation: Dr. Christine Herrmann’s “[Introduction
    to Infectious
    Diseases](http://www.bioedonline.org/presentations/index.cfm#presentation1)”
-   “[Discovery Health Videos](http://health.discovery.com/videos/)”

**Requirements for Completion:**  In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2 as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more exploratory material presented in the latter
units.  You will also need to complete the following:

-   Unit 1.1 Assessments
-   Unit 2.1.2 Assignment
-   Unit 5.1 Assignment
-   Unit 5.2.2.3 Assessment
-   Unit 5.2.4:  Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Notice that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and problem sets listed above.

In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score will be tabulated as soon as you complete
it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment: ** This course should take you a total of **86.5
hours** to complete.  Each unit contains a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time that you are expected to spend on each subunit. 
These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories and determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals
for yourself.  Use the time advisories to help you plot out your
schedule of when you do each unit/subunit and on which days of the
week. 

**Tips/Suggestions:**  It is important that you take notes for all
readings, lectures, and learning tasks.  When available, you may choose
to print out articles and take notes directly on them.  You may want to
use the course units and their subunits to create an outline for your
notes.
