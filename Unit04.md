**Unit 4: Diseases of the Immune System** <span id="4"></span> 
**Diseases of the immune system are typically caused by immune systems
that are either too active or not active enough.  Diseases that can
result from an underactive immune system include AIDS (Autoimmune
Deficiency Syndrome) and SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
Syndrome).  An overactive immune system can cause allergies and asthma,
as well as autoimmune disorders such as Lupus and Insulin Dependent
Diabetes Mellitus.  This unit focuses on these prototype diseases,
although there are thousands of disease states that can impact the
immune system.**

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 12 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1.2: 3 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Describe how HIV develops into AIDS and the treatment options for
    this disease.
-   Compare and contrast diseases involving an overactive and
    underactive immune system, including SCID, HIV, allergies, and
    asthma as examples.
-   Explain how an autoimmune response leads to diseases such as Type 1
    Diabetes Mellitus and Lupus (SLE).
