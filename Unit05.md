**Unit 5: Genetic and Systemic Disease States** <span id="5"></span> 
*There are numerous genetic and systemic diseases that cause tissue
damage and dysfunction.  In this unit, we will briefly examine genetic
and systemic biology by examining prototype disease states that impact
different systems of the body.  For example, we will study how Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy leads to skeletal muscle wasting and how group B
hepatitis destroys the liver’s cells.  When we review the basics of
genetics, we will see how cystic fibrosis causes widespread problems in
the human body.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Explain how genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, are passed
    from parents to offspring.
-   Describe how changes in the skeletal system anatomy and physiology
    lead to the development of diseases such as osteoporosis.
-   List the main ways that skeletal muscle is altered in muscle
    disease, including muscular dystrophy.
-   Identify the changes that occur in the circulatory system with
    atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction.
-   Outline the major changes that occur in renal diseases such as
    glomerulonephritis.
-   Compare and contrast the changes to the reproductive system seen
    with HIV and syphilis.
-   Diagram the levels of damage seen with first-, second-, and
    third-degree burns.
-   Define the major physiology that occurs with hypothyroidism.
-   Write a list of cellular and tissue changes seen with cirrhosis of
    the liver.
-   Create a list of signs, symptoms, and changes that are observed with
    Alzheimer’s disease.
