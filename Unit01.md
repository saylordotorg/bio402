title: "BIO402: Pathobiology"
course_description: "A detailed study of the subject of human disease, placing special emphasis on the cause of disease at the tissue level. Focuses on what happens at the molecular and cellular level during inflammation and the immune response, infectious disease, and diseases of the immune system and body systems."

**Unit 1: Molecules, Cells and Tissues** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will provide you with a basic understanding of the human
body’s organization at the molecular and cellular level.  Molecules
interact and combine with one another to provide the components
necessary for life and to create organisms made up of cells and
tissues. *  
  
 *Individual chemical compounds come together to create organelles and
cellular structures that create the basic unit of life, the cell.  Each
cell has unique properties and structure based upon its function. For
example, cells lining the oral cavity (mouth) and gastrointestinal track
are different from red blood cells, carrying oxygen or neurons (nerve
cells), carrying an electrochemical signal.  Single cells combine to
form the four tissue types, epithelial, connective, nervous, and
muscle.  All of the body’s organs and organ systems are constructed from
these four tissue types.  Once you have a basic understanding of
molecules, cells, and tissues in their normal state, we will explore
them in altered or diseased states.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 12 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.1: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.2: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 1.3: 4 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   Explain how atoms combine to form larger molecules such as proteins
    and carbohydrates.
-   Describe the function of cellular organelles and how these
    structures make up cells.
-   Outline the four major types of tissues and give examples of each.

     Instructions:  This is an excellent website that will introduce you
    to the basics of atoms and molecules.  Do not let its name fool
    you.  You should go through each of the modules for Matter,
    Elements, Atoms, Reactions, and Biochemistry.  At the end of each
    module, please take the quiz to assess what you have learned.  If
    you have difficulty with the quiz, review the material and take the
    quiz a second (or even third!) time.

     Instructions:  This reading will introduce you to the basic unit of
    life—the cell.  Inside the cell, you will find organelles (literally
    little organs) that enable the cell to function.  These organelles
    are suspended in a gel-like material known as cytoplasm.  Cells are
    made up of the molecules that we previously explored.  Make sure to
    take notes on how the cell is organized and how the structure of the
    cell is important for its function.
